''' Testing divisibility by 3,5,10Author: Pushpanjali S'''#typecasting str to int since input() results a string number=int(input('select a number of your choice \n')) if number%2==0: print('number is divisible by 2')elif number%3==0: print('number is disible by 3')elif number%5==0:  print('number is divisible by 5')elif number%7==0:  print('number is divisible by 7')else:  print('not divisible by 2,3,5 or 7');
